## Haii Welcome to Hazine's place 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in software development and a creative side rooted in graphic design. I'm still figuring things out, but I enjoy learning by building projects, experimenting with ideas, and improving a little every day. 

I create whatever I hyperfixate on at the moment. I like working at the intersection of logic and visuals.
